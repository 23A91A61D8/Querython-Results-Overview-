This project showcases:
- Branch-wise analytics for CSE, AIML, IT, DS, ECE, and IoT
- Round-wise filtering to observe drop-off rates and performance trends
- Interactive slicers for dynamic exploration by Branch, College, and Technology
- Strategic insights to support academic planning and future event design
Tools used:--
- Excel: Initial data entry, formatting, and structuring for import
- Data Cleaning: Preprocessing raw data to remove inconsistencies and prepare for analysis
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Custom calculations, dynamic filtering, and KPI logic within Power BI
- Power BI: Dashboard creation, data modeling, slicer configuration, and interactive visualizations
- Visualization Techniques: Bar charts, slicers, and layered panels for intuitive data storytelling
